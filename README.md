# SHA2Checker
Quick n' dirty SHA-2 file integrity checker script for any hash value generated by an SHA-2 function (224, 256, 384 &amp; 512).  
Developed in Python using the secure hash library **"hashlib"** and **"argparse"** for the command-line arguments.  
## Usage
Download the Python script available in this repository (`sha2checker.py`). Once downloaded, run it with `python` or `python3` through your terminal. You will have to define **3** parameters:  
>`-f`, `--function`: Which SHA-2 function you need to hash your file with (sha224/sha256/sha384/sha512).  
>`-fi`, `--file`: file to be hashed. Use the absolute route if the file is not in the same directory as the script.  
>`-s`, `--sum`: Hash value issued by the file owner.  
>*Taken directly from each argument's help text*.
